## Installation
1. Grab the two files (Makefile, etiquette.c) from the server and store it to a temporary location.

	a. Manually

        1. Click 'etiquette.c' above
        2. Click 'Raw'
        3. Save it as 'etiquette.c' to a temporary folder
        4. Repeat steps 1-3 with 'Makefile' (optional)

    b. Through git

        mkdir ~/etiquette
        cd ~/etiquette
        git clone https://github.com/TheCharlesJosh/EEE11-Etiquette.git .

2. Build the application.

    a. Default:

        make

    b. If you don't like Makefiles:

        gcc etiquette.c -o etiquette

3. Run it.

        ./etiquette

## Usage
In order to cushion the recursion (sick linez bro, drops mic), running the program as is will trigger Safe Mode. This will limit the recursion up to 333 times. To override this setting, run it with the argument `--hardcore`, like so:


    ./etiquette --hardcore


When you have the message fully internalized, press `Ctrl` then `C`.
